# Autor - Venkata Ramkiran Chevendra
Python 3 Code and data dump to demonstrate Fitt's Law
Input paramters:
----------------

Give the number of circles as the input parameters while executing the python file
Ex: python Fittslaw_code.py 20 (while running from command line, where 20 represents the number of circles)

Randomize the amplitude and target size:
----------------------------------------

Comment the hard coded values for bradius(amplitude) and tradius(target size) and uncomment the next lines for randomizing those.

Change the paths to the local machine of your computer.

Also you can change the scales of the various plots by chaning plt.axis line in the code.
